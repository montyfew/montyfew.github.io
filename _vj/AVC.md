The works I produce as a musician have often been inspired by a sense of place and rooting within the city I live. Past experiences as an architecture student also inform my mapping of location, both in a physical and emotional sense.This project began to examine the ways in which these processes intersect, using VJ (video jockey) software as a tool to cross over the audio and visual.You can explore my audiovisual sketches alongside the accompanying essay in [website form][website].
