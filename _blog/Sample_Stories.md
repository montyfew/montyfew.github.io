I was invited to (pounced on) a dilligently researched radio show by my esteemed housemate [Cam Christie][website], exploring the connections between Post-rock and sampling.

Cam guided the discussion to allow me to explore my specific interest in Post-rock and edgelands, mainly through the music of Bark Psychosis. My research is indebted to Archer Sanderson's article 'Boundary Sounds' in [Weird Walk #4][website2] which I highly recommend.

Thank you to Tabbie of [Sample Stories][website3] for hosting this rather unconventional episode!
