My audiovisual practice is informed by the relationship between music and place, having become intrigued by this theme after living in and undertaking musical projects in a handful of different cities across the UK. Through sonic explorations, film making and intermedial VJ techniques, Iâ€™m interested in exploring the intersections of music and the moving image.
