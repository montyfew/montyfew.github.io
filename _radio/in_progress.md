Looking back to 2020 when I was joined by [Katogo][website3] to share influential tracks and the seeds of new ideas, informing our collaborative process which fused my guitars with his electronic production.

This initially remote collaboration, between Rainham and Sheffield, went on to be released as our EP [Patterns / Return Home][website]. We were also lucky enough to perform it [live][website2] for Crossovers Collective in London.
