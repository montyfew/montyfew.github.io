As the Summer of 2017 drew to and end, Outdoor Scene began the shift from a two-piece guitar and drums project to a solo form.

During the winter months, I experimented with layers of guitar and vocals hewn roughly in Audacity. The tentative addition of drum samples then paved the way for a new kind of live performance. My housemate at the time, Tom (on piano), lent me his loop pedal. From there whole new territories of layered sound opened up.

In April I took some time out from my day job and set off to new cities, eager to take fresh ideas on the road and absorb the inspiration that new places bring. Armed with a guitar, loop pedal and iPod full of beats, I sought refuge with friends in different cities. The pubs of London, Bristol and Cambridge opened mics and amplifiers with welcoming arms.

Two weeks away from routine helped provide the impetus for 'Voice Memos // Blakeney Demos'. The title comes from captured moments recording audio on iPod voice memos, alongside the attic space in which I was recording. It was my first experience of musical self-sufficiency, writing and recording all the tracks myself.
