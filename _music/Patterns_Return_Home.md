A collaborative EP forged in the ether between 2020-21, combining the guitar loops of Mono Works with the grime production of Katogo. These tracks are a distillation of ideas sent back and forth between Mono Works in Sheffield and Katogo in Rainham, sharing musical inspirations and processes along the way. From the south of the north to outside the east.

Mixed by Zac Ssempa and Monty Williams.
