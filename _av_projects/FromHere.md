This short [ethnographic film][website] was shot in South London with my friend and fellow musician Ed Freeth. I was keen to use the process of filming as a way to explore my own sense of place in London through the lens of another person’s music. Ed’s journey reflects my own, moving to London from the Midlands. Could filming Ed’s journey form a mirror to my own experience?
