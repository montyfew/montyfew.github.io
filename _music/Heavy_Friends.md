A motley comp of wayward folk, pensive emo and cosmic disco from several heavy friends.

The ancient realms of Salop, Sheffield and London are all here, breathing through each and every droned string, wallop of french horn and parched harmony.

Track 1 feat. Anna Rocchi on guest vox.
Track 4 feat. Freya Cunningham on french horn.
Tracks 1, 2 feat. Emergency Ration Ensemble on drums.
