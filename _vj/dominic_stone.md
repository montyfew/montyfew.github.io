Dominic played in one of two 'Imagery' shows I helped put together at The Junction, a space for exploratory sounds and images. After listening to a recording of Dominic's improvisations over field recordings, I delved into footage from my archive to visualise the images which Dominic's sounds had me imagining. The footage used was originally taken in the Welsh borders and has been rekindled in a new context.

I used Resolume software to respond to the loudness and pitch of Dominic’s violin, each time revealing flickering footage which explores a theme of abstracted reality. On top of the live video I’ve chosen to overlay the generated Resolume footage again, at points dipping out into total darkness (reflecting the live performance). I’m interested in how we can move from a real to virtual space through this technique, drawing out the different layers of performance.
