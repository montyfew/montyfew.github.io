An impromptu collaboration with live coder [Heavy Lifting][website] at Sheffield's [Sidney and Matilda][website2].

It's a common practice at live coding events to project the code so I decided to expand on this theme by multiplying and layering the code, inculding audio reactive elements. Lucy of HL was able to respond to this by adding a yellow waveform to her visuals, which I appreciated alongside the existing pastel colours of the text.

The top down photo of our equipment (HL left, Monty right) shows me beginning to use a MIDI controller, enabling more tactile and instinctive manipulation of AV parameters.
