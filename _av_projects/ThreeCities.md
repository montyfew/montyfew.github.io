An ongoing collaboration with Taiwanese artist [Ya Hsuan Hsiao][website], collaging audiovisual material from Sheffield, Taipei and London. This project explores the themes of belonging, reflection and disorientation. By dealing with the relationship between different locations and places we reflect on our own identities and the concept of home.

Our audiovisual composition was most recently presented at Hypha Gallery as part of [Uncanny Playgrounds][website2], involving a performative text score.
