    The content of this project has emerged through explorations of the city’s ‘edgelands’ and ‘luminous locales’. My work taps into the discourse of psychogeography, building on writings and film making in this field. I’ve created a series of compositions which bring audio-reactive live visual techniques into the processing of imagery, introducing transient and unstable visuals as a way of representing these places. You can explore my [accompanying website][website] along your own path, finding commonalities and dialogues between the collated fragments.
