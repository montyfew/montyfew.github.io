My debut show for Foodhall Community Radio, aired in August 2020.

An unearthing of the magnificent .mp3s from deep within my iPod's whirring hard disk. This show features guest Adam Zejma from [Tye Die Tapes][website], exploring the UK's DIY music scene with a focus on Sheffield spaces and labels.
