The seeds of Outdoor Scene were sewn in a Moor End Road basement, squeezing guitar, bass and drums between the damp brick walls.

A strong foundation had been laid, but our bassist moved southward, leaving a two-piece formation standing back to back. We moved from Moor End Road to the Moor Oaks Triangle, tracing new ideas over previous sketches.

Stolen moments between the architecture studio feed into this EP, finding haven in the tiny spare room of our rented house.

Living amongst good friends, not realising the moment till it had passed, fond memories in a snapshot of time. We hope to capture these fragments.

released October 9, 2017
