Two pieces of audiovisual performance that I was involved with last year were informative on this project. They were both collaborative performances where I was creating audio-reactive live visuals. For these purposes I use Resolume VJ software to receive audio input then use this signal to manipulate effects on the video. The first example shows live visuals for Cascade (Robinson, 2022) while the second demonstrates a similar performative environment for Dominic Stone. When I went through the process of creating live audio-reactive visuals for both these people I initially listened to recordings of their music and tried to imagine what terrains are evoked by the sound. The idea of a sound evoking terrain was referenced from Mark’s Fisher’s book ‘Ghosts of My Life’ where he talks about the dance music genre Jungle which ‘evokes a terrain’ of London (Fisher, 2014, p. 30).
