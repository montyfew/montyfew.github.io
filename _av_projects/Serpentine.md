    A documented live [audiovisual composition][website] which explains the narrative of a thought process. In this work I adopted an ephemeral and emotive method of architectural site analysis, using footage and sounds captured by the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park. The composition explores feelings of distance and disconnection within the densely layered grain of London’s terrain.
