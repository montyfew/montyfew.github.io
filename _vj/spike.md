Working with [Spike][website] began with the notion of video feedback, processed through my VJ software. We tested this approach in the studio and a first live show at [Spanners][website2], culminating in a creation of a music video which sits somewhere between live documentation and processed imagery. We wrote a bit more about it for [Sonic Scope][website3] journal.

Building on this process, a second live outing for [Crossovers Collective][website4] allowed us to explore the live possibilites of this setup further. In this collaboration we were able to visualise a new environment by processing the live image, responding to the rhythms and atmospheres of Spike's music.
