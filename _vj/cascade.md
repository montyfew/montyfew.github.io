[Cascade][website] played in one of two 'Imagery' shows I helped put together at The Junction, a space for exploratory sounds and images. I decided to pair her dream-like soundscape with footage I'd taken at the time during a night time bus ride around London, staring out of the window. Cascade then edited together live documentation of the show with the output from my live visual software, resulting in this composition which sits somewhere between the moment and imagination.
