Five years since the release of my first Mono Works recordings, [8 Landscapes][website], I bring you Mono Works #4: Home. To mark the anniversary, this EP is also available in [postcard form][website2].

While the recordings return to a more sparse arrangement between guitar and vocals, I was honoured to expand on this through the EP release show at [Underwater][website3] featuring Reuben Das of [Deaf Inspector][website4] on keys and [Katogo][website5] guesting on the drum machine. Thank you to Demi for curating the show and for my good friend [Sung Loh][website6] for jumping on the bill.

As an exclusive treat for your website surfers, here's a live recording of our set:
