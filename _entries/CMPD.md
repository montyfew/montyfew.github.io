In this project I explored the practice of mapping through the related discourses of ‘place’ and ‘assemblage’, each with a corresponding video. I wondered if audiovisual performance could become a kind of mapping. The [accompanying website][website] invites participatory performance from the user. You may navigate different directions, combining various views of its content.

I presented this project as part of the Royal Musical Association's 'Music and/as Process Study Day', you can watch a version of this presentation here.
